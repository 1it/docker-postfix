## v0.1.2

### New Features

- **Fallback relay support** — Configure a backup SMTP relay via `FALLBACK_RELAY_HOST` that activates when primary delivery (direct or relay) fails with a temporary error
- **Fallback relay authentication** — Optional `FALLBACK_SMTP_USERNAME` / `FALLBACK_SMTP_PASSWORD` for authenticated fallback delivery

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix SASL crash in relay mode without credentials** — SASL auth was unconditionally enabled in relay mode even when no credentials were provided, causing `sasl_passwd.db: No such file or directory` errors. SASL is now only enabled when credentials are actually configured.

### New Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `FALLBACK_RELAY_HOST` | Fallback relay when primary delivery fails (e.g., `[backup-smtp.example.com]:587`) |
| `FALLBACK_SMTP_USERNAME` | Fallback relay authentication username |
| `FALLBACK_SMTP_PASSWORD` | Fallback relay authentication password |
